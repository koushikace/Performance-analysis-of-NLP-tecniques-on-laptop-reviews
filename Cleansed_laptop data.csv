Awesome display with good performance,5.0
"laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.",4.0
